#1.Discuss the business goal?

In this Project we will discuss the credit card Fraud Detection.

#2.identify where the dataset was retrieved from?

This project data set and codes is accessible on :

```{r, echo=TRUE}
url <- "https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-machine-learning-project-credit-card-fraud-detection/"
print(url)
```

#3.identify the code that imported and saved your dataset in R?

```{r creditcard , echo=TRUE}
creditcard <- read_csv("creditcard.csv")
```

We have data about `r nrow(creditcard)` credit card transactions includes fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.in following lines we'll learn more about this data set :

```{r, echo=TRUE}
table(creditcard$Class)
summary(creditcard$Amount)
names(creditcard)
var(creditcard$Amount)
```

#5.discuss any data preparation, missing values and errors?

In this section we are going to delete missing values and scale our data :

```{r, echo=TRUE}
na.omit(creditcard)
creditcard$Amount=scale(creditcard$Amount)
```

By comparing the row numbers before and after the data cleaning, we conclude that there are no missing value in this data set, also we standardize the Amount column.

#6.	discuss the modeling?

we will implement a decision tree algorithm : 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
decisionTree_model <- rpart(Class ~ . , creditcard, method = 'class')
predicted_val <- predict(decisionTree_model, creditcard, type = 'class')
probability <- predict(decisionTree_model, creditcard, type = 'prob')
```

#7.produce and discuss the output?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rpart.plot(decisionTree_model)
```

#8.provide explanation?

As the above plot indicates the fraud boarder for each variable.
